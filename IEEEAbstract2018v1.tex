A new Large area x-Y COverage Readout Integrated Strip telescope (\lycoris) is being built to address user demands,
as an improvement of the DESY test beam infrastructure within the Advanced European Infrastructures for Detectors at Accelerators project (AIDA-2020).
The \lycoris consists of 6 layers of \SI{25}{\micro\metre} pitch strip Si sensor readout by 2 bump-bonded ASICs (KPiX),
running at a timing resolution as multiples of \SI{80}{\nano\second};
its active area is designed to be 10$\times$\SI{10}{\square\centi\metre}, extendable to 10$\times$\SI{20}{\square\centi\metre}.
It will be mounted inside a \SI{1}{\tesla} solenoid magnet,
providing a spatial resolution better than \SI{10}{\micro\metre} along the bending direction,
and a resolution better than \SI{1}{\milli\metre} along the magnetic field.
The full readout system was tested with a hexagonal pixel sensor in the lab with a Sr90 source,
and later tested in the electron beam at DESY in May and October 2017;
the first assembled modules were tested in the spring 2018.
First results of the \lycoris prototype will be presented with a comparison to simulation,
besides, the characterization of sensor and readout system are also included.

\section*{Motivation and Concept}
%\linenumbers

DESY test beam facility provides $e^-/e^+$ beams with energies from 1 to \SI{6}{\GeV} up to \SI{1}{\MHz}
%converted from bremsstrahlung beams from carbon fibre targets in the electron-positron synchrotron DESY II,
with three test beam lines (21, 22 and 24).
The beam lines 21 and 22 are both equiped with a EUDET-type beam telescope~$^{\cite{eudet}}$ with an active area of around 1$\times$\SI{2}{\square\centi\metre},
which is based on a fine pitch \uppercase{mimosa}~26 monolithic sensor with an event readout frame of \SI{115.2}{\micro\second};
the beam line 24 is equiped with a \SI{1}{\tesla} solenoid, namely PCMAG, at a diametre of $\sim$\SI{85}{\centi\metre} with its wall of $\sim20X_0$,
inside which both the EUDET-type telescope and the Device Under Test (DUT) can be inserted.
The EUDET-type beam telescope at DESY is proven to meet user demands very well and thus in a high ($\sim$70\%) demand,
however, its active area is limited for momentum measurements for PCMAG users.
Therefore, a new telescope is in need to provide a spatial resolution better than \SI{10}{\micro\metre} along the bending direction, and a resolution better than \SI{1}{\milli\metre} along the magnetic field,
with a large active area of 10$\times$10/\SI{20}{\square\centi\metre},
to cover 90\% to 96\% particles with energies from 1 to \SI{6}{\GeV} considering momentum smearing after the magnet wall.

The 10$\times$\SI{10}{\square\centi\metre} SiD tracker strip sensor at a pitch of \SI{25}{\micro\metre}, readout by 2 1024-channel ASICs, KPiX~$^{\cite{kpix}}$, can provide a resolution of around \SI{7.2}{\micro\metre},
was hence chosen, and the other requirements can be achieved by a \SI{2}{\degree} tilt.
The new telescope, \lycoris is finally designed as a 6-plane strip telescope in a mirror symmetric setup, with its upperstream orientation of (0, -\SI{2}{\degree}, \SI{2}{\degree}), see Figure~\ref{fig:1figs} (left), and it is controlled by a data acquisition (DAQ) FPGA board.
When a beam particle passes a Photomultiplier (PMT), the connected Trigger Logic Unit (TLU) will send a trigger to the telescope and to the DUT for synchronization;
the telescope data is digitized and readout by the bumpbonded KPiXs, then packed by the DAQ board and sent to the connected PC, the total integration time is .
A common DAQ software from the beam telescope community, EUDAQ2~$^{\cite{eudaq2}}$, is used, which also helps to synchronize the run control of telescope, TLU, and DUT.

\section*{Assembly and Tests}

The KPiX readout system were characterized before the sensor delivery with some known hexagonal pixel sensors,
including understanding how to synchronize the KPiX chip data taking cycles to the DESY beam structure, as well as to other devices, like TLU, and various DUTs.
It was tested first with a Sr90 source in the lab, and then in the DESY test beam with energies from 4 to \SI{6}{\GeV} in May and October 2017~\cite{lycoris1}.

The strip sensors were delivered by Hamamtsu in summer 2017, showing very good electric features and all fully depleted at around \SI{50}{\volt}.
The first assembled sensors, see one example in Figure~\ref{fig:1figs} (right), were tested in spring 2018, with a Sr90 source in the lab at DESY, and several DESY test beam weeks are in schedule in fall 2018.
Figure~\ref{fig:2figs} shows the fired strip distribution over one data taking run, collected by one KPiX chip from one assembled module, under a Sr90 source in a self-trigger mode,
demenstrating that the assembled module is capable of seeing signals.

\lycoris telescope is scheduled to be delivered early 2019, with a TLU and a reconstruction software ready-to-use for user.
In this contribution, the latest \lycoris prototype will be presented, with its first results and a comparison to simulation;
the characterization of the sensor and readout system will also be included.
