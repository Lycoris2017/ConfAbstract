A new Large area x-Y COverage Readout Integrated Strip telescope (\lycoris) is being built to address user demands,
as an improvement of the DESY test beam infrastructure within the Advanced European Infrastructures for Detectors at Accelerators project (AIDA-2020).
The \lycoris consists of 6 layers of \SI{25}{\micro\metre} pitch strip Si sensor readout by 2 bump-bonded ASICs (KPiX),
running at a timing resolution as multiples of \SI{80}{\nano\second};
its active area is designed to be 10$\times$\SI{10}{\square\centi\metre}, extendable to 10$\times$\SI{20}{\square\centi\metre}.
It will be mounted inside a \SI{1}{\tesla} solenoid magnet,
providing a spatial resolution better than \SI{10}{\micro\metre} along the bending direction,
and a resolution better than \SI{1}{\milli\meter} along the magnetic field.
The full readout system was tested with a hexagonal pixel sensor in the lab with a Sr90 source,
and later tested in the electron beam at DESY in May and October 2017;
the first assembled modules were tested in the spring 2018.
First results of the \lycoris prototype will be presented with a comparison to simulation,
besides, the characterization of sensor and readout system are also included.

\section*{A large active area beam telescope}
%\linenumbers

DESY test beam facility provides $e^-/e^+$ beams with energies from 1 to \SI{6}{\GeV} up to \SI{1}{\MHz}
%converted from bremsstrahlung beams from carbon fibre targets in the electron-positron synchrotron DESY II,
with three test beam lines (21, 22 and 24).
The beam lines 21 and 22 are both equiped with a EUDET-type beam telescope~$^{\cite{eudet}}$ with an active area of around 1$\times$\SI{2}{\square\centi\metre},
which is based on a fine pitch \uppercase{mimosa}~26 monolithic sensor with an event readout frame of \SI{115.2}{\micro\second};
the beam line 24 is equiped with a \SI{1}{\tesla} solenoid, namely PCMAG, at a diameter of $\sim$\SI{85}{\centi\metre} with its wall of $\sim20X_0$,
inside which both the EUDET-type telescope and the Device Under Test (DUT) can be inserted.
The EUDET-type beam telescope at DESY is proven to meet user demands very well and thus in a high ($\sim$70\%) demand,
however, its active area is limited to cover the bending curvature for PCMAG users.
Therefore, the \lycoris telescope is designed to have a large active area of 10$\times$\SI{10}{\square\centi\metre}, extendable to 10$\times$\SI{20}{\square\centi\metre},
in order to cover 90\% to 96\% particles with energies from 1 to \SI{6}{\GeV} considering momentum smearing after the magnet wall.

The SiD tracker strip sensor at a pitch of \SI{25}{\micro\metre}, readout by two bumpbonded ASICs, KPiX~$^{\cite{kpix}}$, was chosen to meet the design requirements from simulation studies at DESY,
KPiX is a 1024 channel readout ASIC, running in a power pulse structure, which needs to be synchronized to the DESY beam structure, as well as to other connected device, such as the Trigger Logic Unit (TLU), and different DUTs.
The sensors were delivered by Hamamtsu in summer 2017, showing very good electric features and all fully depleting at around \SI{50}{\volt}.

The first assembled sensors were under tests with a Sr90 source in the lab at DESY , and several weeks DESY beam tests are planned in fall 2018.

Plan and target to show.

In this contribution, we will describe the latest \lycoris prototype, and we will present the first results on testing the prototype with comparison to simulation, as well as the sensor and readout system characterization.
